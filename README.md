# Technical tests

In this repository I uploaded all the projects that @midudev proposed on the page https://pruebastecnicas.com/

if you want to clone all the projects you should use the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/altobellidardo/pruebas-tecnicas
```

instead if you only want a single project you should use for example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/altobellidardo/pruebas-tecnicas/01-reading-list
```


each project includes a readme.md file with all the description, uses and recommendations
